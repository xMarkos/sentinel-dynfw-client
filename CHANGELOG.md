## [Unreleased] - 2026-08-09

Complete rewrite and clean-up. Split into modules and added ability to implement other firewall backends in a modular way.

### Added

- Added support for IPv6 which now runs in a single process as the original IPv4 blocker.
- Added argument `--ipset6`.
- Ability to block IPv6 networks from singular address (argument `--expand-ipv6-prefix`).
- Added dummy backend (for debugging/monitoring).
- Added argument `--keep-on-exit` which controls if firewall tables should remain after the program ends.
- Firewall is now completely configured automatically and no manual setup of tables, sets, chains, or rules is needed.
- Proper parsing of sentinel data messages.

### Changed

- Argument `--ipset` changed to `--ipset4`.
- Argument `--table` changed to `--nft-table`.
- Interfacing with nftables now using python bindings and its structured JSON API instead of executing command line.

### Removed

- Removed iptables backend.
- Systemd notifications (service now runs as type=exec and logs were improved to not need it).

## [Unreleased] - 2024-07-30

### Added

- Argument `--backend` for specifying if using Nftables or legacy Ipset.
- Argument `--cache-dir` for specifying a directory path where certificates
  are to be stored.
- Argument `--table` to set the table name in Nftables.
- Argument `--syslog` explicitly redirects log messages to Syslog.
- Configuration for the Systemd service is now read from `/etc/default/sentinel-dynfw-client`.
- Send heartbeats to the ZMQ server once per minute, enabling the ZMQ library to
  automatically reconnect if a reply is not received in time. This fixes a "stuck client"
  in case the connection is abruptly lost, as the ZMQ socket would still be connected.
- Support Systemd notifications.

### Changed

- General code refactor and update.
- The Systemd service file has been updated according to code changes, and a certain
  number of security options has been added.
- The Systemd service reads configuration parameters from `/etc/default/sentinel-dynfw-client`.
  Default values are provided.
- Enable dual stack support when connecting to the Sentinel server, so that the connection
  goes over IPv6 if IPv6 connectivity is available.

### Removed

- Argument `--cert`  and `--renew` have been removed and the server certificate
  is always downloaded on start.

## [1.4.0] - 2020-08-06

### Added

- Argument `--renew` that automatically receives latest version of server
  certificate on client startup
- Argument `--cert-url` to specify URL used to get server's certificate when
  `--renew` is used

## [1.3.1] - 2020-06-09
